== Service Options

*-c, --connection <name>*::
    Define a service connection to use.
+
This can either be a pre-configured connection name or a service URL.

*-C, --concurrent <value>*::
    Maximum number of concurrent requests to a service.
+
Certain types of actions such as searching can automatically send concurrent
requests to support faster result paging. By default, concurrent requests are
disabled.

*--certificate <path>*::
    Add a custom root certificate.
+
This can be used to connect to a server that has a self-signed certificate
without having to use `--insecure`. Note that this requires a PEM encoded
certificate file.

*-I, --insecure*::
    Ignore invalid service certificates when connecting.

*-P, --proxy <URL>*::
    Use a custom proxy.

*-t, --timeout <seconds>*::
    Set the request timeout in seconds, defaults to 30.
